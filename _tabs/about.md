I am so happy you to be here, let me give you a brief introduction about myself. My name is Cristhian David Britez Martinez (Cristhian Britez) and I was born in Asunci√≥n (Paraguay) on July 18th, 1989. I finished my bachelor degree in System Engineer in 2011.
I started working since 2009 at ITC S.A., hired by my university proffesor, as Lenovo system support and one year later I was promoted as junior Oracle field Engineer, my principal tasks were to manage oracle system hardware from x86 to highend servers and storage systems, I was also responsible for suppport and troubleshooting linux/unix operating systems.

After two years,in 2011 I moved to Excelsis SACIG, an Oracle software gold partner that just began as oracle systems partners, here I was hired to be an integrator with oracle hardware and software.

My first implementation project were with Oracle T4 Sparc server with Solaris 11, where we deployed virtual machines with Oracle VM (Ldoms) or Zones and install on them Oracle RAC and Oracle Database 11Gr2, Oracle weblogic forms and reports and bussiness inteligence . We delevoped a lot of projects with the same configuration in local and extended RAC. Later, I started with Oracle Database Appliance implementation and administration.

At Excelsis I learned a lot technologies based on Oracle: Oracle VM x86 and sparc, Oracle Secure Backup, Oracle Middleware, Oracle ZFS, Oracle Solaris, Oracle Linux, Oracle Grid control and Enterprise Manager, Oracle Database, Oracle RAC, Oracle Dataguard, bash scripting, PLSQL scripting, Oracle Database Appliance

In 2014 I moved to Spain and on April 13th, 2015 I started working at Hewlett Packard Enterprise as Database Engineer, here I was responsible for managing the cloud database platform, making improvements and supporting with database performance issues, shell and plsql scripting.

On June 1st,2017 I was hired by Boheringer Ingelheim as Database Engineer.

I am Database Engineer and Oracle database related product engineer. I love so much working as system engineer and with Oracle in Linux/Unix environments, for me is the best job that I could have. I would like you to visit my Work area, there you will get more detailed info.
